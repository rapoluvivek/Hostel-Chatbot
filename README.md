Here are some key features of the Hostel Chat Bot:

âœ… Complaint Registration: Students can easily register their complaints regarding various hostel-related concerns such as electricity, water, food, furniture, room cleaning, and more. The intuitive interface ensures a seamless user experience.

âœ… Warden Dashboard: Wardens have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can view and manage complaints specific to their respective hostels. This centralized system enables efficient complaint handling and resolution.

âœ… Problem-based Search: The Hostel Chat Bot empowers users to search for complaints based on specific problems. Whether it's an issue with electricity or water supply, students can quickly find related complaints and track their progress.

âœ… Enhanced Website Design: The website has undergone a complete redesign, offering a modern and user-friendly interface. The intuitive layout ensures easy navigation, making it convenient for students and wardens to interact with the platform.

âœ… Secure Authentication: We have implemented robust authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure that only enrolled students who are currently residing in the hostels can access the Hostel Chat Bot. This adds an extra layer of security and protects the privacy of users' information.

I am incredibly proud of the hard work and dedication put into developing the Hostel Chat Bot. It is the result of a collaborative effort from a talented team, and we believe it will significantly improve the communication and complaint resolution process within our hostel community. ðŸ™Œ
